In this question, we will compare this fixed-point system to a 16-bit floating-point system that adheres to all IEEE-754 conventions, including denorms, NaNs, etc., with a 5-bit exponent and an exponent bias of -15.  
  
Write -22.375 in hexadecimal using the 16-bit fixed-point system described above.  
__ C01 __ :  0b1 (negative) 10110 (22) 0110000000 (.375) = 1101 1001 1000 0000 = 0xD980
  
Write -22.375 in hexadecimal using the 16-bit floating point system system described above.  
__ C02 __ :  0xCD98
We already know that -22.375 in binary is = 0b1 10110.011
    
How many numbers in the range [16, 64) (including 16, excluding 64) can be represented by the fixed-point system described above?  
__ C03 __ :  
16 = 0b10000.0000000000, so the largest num would be 0b11111.1111111111  
0b11111.1111111111 = 2^5 - 2^10 <= 32
