## Part 1
Suppose we have the following program.  
```c
int remainder(int a, int b)
{
    while (a >= b)
        a -= b;
    return a;
}
```
For a RISC architecture (RV32 in particular), our RISC-V compiler generates the following assembly code.  
```
loop:
    blt x1, x2, done
    sub x1, x1, x2
    j loop
done:
    ...
```
Assume that RISC-V instructions are 4 bytes each. Assume data values are 4 bytes each.  
How many bytes is the RISC-V program?  
__ D01 __ : 12(O)  
Assume a=7 and b=3. How many data bytes are loaded/stored in the RISC program?  
__ D02 __ : 12(X) 0(O) 
## Part 2
Suppose we have a simple integer vector-vector addition implementation below.  
```
# for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
#     c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
Loop:
    lw x2, 0(x1)     # load a[i]
    lw x4, 0(x3)     # load b[i]
    add x5, x2, x4   # c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
    __D03__          # store c[i]
    addi x1, x1, 4   # bump pointer
    addi x3, x3, 4   # bump pointer
    addi x6, x6, 4   # bump pointer
    addi x7, x7, 1   # i++
    __D04__          # x8 holds N
```
Complete the above code to make the RISC-V assembly function as described in the comment.  
__ D03 __ =  
__ D04 __ =  
  
Next, consider a compiler that unrolls loops and reschedules instructions, assuming the loop operates on an even number of elements in the vectors. Shown below.  
```
Loop:
    lw x2, 0(x1)      # load a[i]
    addi x1, x1, 8    # bump pointer a
    lw x4, 0(x3)      # load b[i]
    addi x3, x3, 8    # bump pointer b
    __D05__           # load a[i+1]
    add x5, x2, x4    # c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
    __D06__           # load b[i+1]
    addi x7, x7, 2    # i+=2
    __D07__           # store c[i]
    add x10, x8, x9  # c[i+1] = a[i+1] + b[i+1]
    __D08__           # store c[i+1]
    __D09__           # bump pointer c
    __D10__           # x11 holds N
```
__ D05 __ = 
__ D06 __ = 
__ D07 __ = 
__ D08 __ = 
__ D09 __ = 
__ D010 __ =
