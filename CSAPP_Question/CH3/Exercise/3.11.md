It is common to find assembly-code lines of the form:
```
xorq %rdx,%rdx
```
in code that was generated from C where no exclusive-or operations were present.  
  
A. Explain the effect of this particular exclusive-or instruction and what useful
operation it implements.  
  
Ans: 這可以讓 %rdx 的值變成0，因其對相同的數值進行互斥或運算的結果
  
B. What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in assembly code?  
  
Ans: 可以直接用 moveq 處理  
```
moveq $0, %rdx
```
  
C. Compare the number of bytes to encode any two of these three different implementations of the same operation.  
  
Ans: 可以使用下列指令達到相同效果
```
xorl %edx, %edx  <- 兩個字節
movl $0, %edx    <- 五個字節
```
